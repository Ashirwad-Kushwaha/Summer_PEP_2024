// What is backend?
// The backend is the server-side of an application.
//  It's responsible for handling requests and sending responses back 
// to the client. It's typically written in languages 
// like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, etc. and runs on a server. 
// The backend communicates with a database to store and retrieve data, 
// and it's responsible for handling all the logic of the application.


/**
 * A router is a component in a web application that maps URLs to functions. 
 * It's responsible for handling incoming requests and directing them to 
 * the appropriate handler functions. 
 * 
 * In the context of a Node.js application, a router can be implemented using 
 * a variety of libraries such as Express.js, Koa.js, or Hapi.js.
 * 
 * The router takes an incoming request and matches it against a series of 
 * routes defined by the developer. It then calls the appropriate handler 
 * function to generate a response for that request.
 * 
 * Routers are an essential part of web application development, as they 
 * allow developers to separate the concerns of routing and handling 
 * requests, making the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.

/**
 * A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to every device 
 * connected to a computer network. It's used to identify the device on the network and 
 * prevent collisions between devices. 
 * 
 * A MAC address is typically a 6-byte number, written in hexadecimal format like 
 * 00:11:22:33:44:55. 
 * 
 * MAC addresses are used in the link layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. 
 * They're used for local-area networks (LANs) and are mandatory for all network devices.
